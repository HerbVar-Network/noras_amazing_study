# CONTRIBUTING #


### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that itâ€™s a problem. If you have found a bug, [create an associated issue](https://github.com/Herbvar/-----/issues) and illustrate the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Github Actions and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.  

*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  

<!---
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2). 
---->
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
